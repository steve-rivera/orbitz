          <strong>How do the credit card rewards work?</strong>
          <p>
            With the
            <strong>
              <span class='service'>extra20</span>
              credit card,
            </strong>
            you can get paid for your everday spending. You spend $400, we pay you $10 per month. Then, you get another $10 per month when you spend another $400. That's a total of $20 a month that we credit back to you.

        <div class='question' id='question2'>
          <strong>Is this just a one-time promotion?</strong>
          <p>
            This will not be a one-time promotion. There's no cap on how long you can collect your $20 per month as long as you qualify. The bonus is credited directly to your monthly bill.
