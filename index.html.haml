            %strong
              %span.service extra20
              credit card,
            you can get paid for your everday spending. You spend $400, we pay you $10 per month. Then, you get another $10 per month when you spend another $400. That's a total of $20 a month that we credit back to you.

        .question#question2
          %strong Is this just a one-time promotion?
          %p
